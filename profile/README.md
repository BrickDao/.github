## ‚ôªÔ∏èGiving for goodüåç


## About BrickDAO

BrickDAO will be joined by a large community of philanthropists who are on a mission of creating something good.  We have interested companies and NPO‚Äôs such as B1G1 as well as Subscription Model

Instead of raising the money once, the funding will be in a Subscription Model.  Subscribers will vote for their favourite projects with their wallet (quadratic funding).  To ensure the DAO continues to develop, it will pay developer contributors from a fixed sum or a percentage of the Budget.

Manage grants to projects to donate bricks to build schools:  Source of bricks could be plastic bricks ‚Äì this supports cleaning up the environment The final goal of this DAO should be to fail, because there is no more plastic waste produced on the planet.  In a sub-DAOs we could create revenue streams to access grants and donations and where the funding would go

When it comes to subscriptions, everybody‚Äôs vote counts only once but they can increase their subscription.  The DAO decides which public good will be accepted to the List of Project.  Grants will available to organisations what will donate bricks to a building project.
At its core, it primarily pools funds for grants, however there will also be opportunity for investing in start-up programmes creating new products.  Only token holders can make proposals and vote on their execution.
